# Employment & Poverty in the United States

## Abstract:

This project takes a brief look into employment and poverty with the analysis being broken down at three different levels: national, state and county. While both topics are analyzed separately, we do attempt to look at any possible relationships between the two as well. After carefull analyzation of all our data, we were able to answer the following questions:
- National Level:
  1. Question 1
  2. Question 2
- State Level:
  1. Question 1
  2. Question 2
- County Level:
  1. Question 1
  2. Question 2
